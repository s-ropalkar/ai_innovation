🧠 ESIP – Essential Supply Intelligence Platform

AI-Powered Decision Intelligence for Sustainable Supply Chains

ESIP is a data-driven supply chain intelligence platform built using Snowflake and Streamlit, designed to help organizations prevent stock-outs, reduce wastage, and enable smart donation & redistribution decisions for essential goods.

This project simulates a real-world essential goods distribution system and applies rule-based AI intelligence on live inventory data.

🚀 Problem Statement

❌ Overstock leading to expiry & waste

❌ Understock leading to stock-outs

❌ Lack of intelligence for timely donation & redistribution

ESIP solves this by:

Continuously analyzing inventory health
